CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS is essential in web 
development because it allows developers to separate content (HTML) from presentation 
(CSS), making it easier to design visually appealing and consistent websites.

CSS defines how HTML elements should be displayed, allowing developers to control
the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of a webpage.
By using CSS, developers can make a website look professional and enhance user experience.

Explanation of CSS Code
In this example, the <style> tag is used within the <head> section of 
the HTML document to add CSS directly.

body Selector: The body selector targets the entire webpage.
               This means that any CSS rules applied to the body tag 
               will affect all the content within the <body> of the HTML document.

background-color: lightblue;: This property sets the background color of 
                  the entire page to light blue. This property affects the
                  appearance of the whole background within the body element.

color: darkblue;: This property changes the text color to dark blue. 
                  This affects all text within the body, including text inside <h1>, 
                  <p>, or other text elements.

font-size: 20px;: This property sets the default font size for all text in 
                  the body to 20 pixels. Font size is measured in pixels (px),
                  and increasing this value will increase the text size.
